.. currentmodule:: discord

API Reference
===============

The following section outlines the API of discord.py.

.. note::

    This module uses the Python logging module to log diagnostic and errors
    in an output independent way.  If the logging module is not configured,
    these logs will not be output anywhere.  See :ref:`logging_setup` for
    more information on how to set up and use the logging module with
    discord.py.

Version Related Info
---------------------

There are two main ways to query version information about the library. For guarantees, check :ref:`version_guarantees`.

.. data:: version_info

    A named tuple that is similar to :obj:`py:sys.version_info`.

    Just like :obj:`py:sys.version_info` the valid values for ``releaselevel`` are
    'alpha', 'beta', 'candidate' and 'final'.

.. data:: __version__

    A string representation of the version. e.g. ``'1.0.0rc1'``. This is based
    off of :pep:`440`.

Event Reference
---------------

This section outlines the different types of events listened by :class:`Client`.

There are two ways to register an event, the first way is through the use of
:meth:`Client.event`. The second way is through subclassing :class:`Client` and
overriding the specific events. For example: ::

    import discord

    class MyClient(discord.Client):
        async def on_message(self, message):
            if message.author == self.user:
                return

            if message.content.startswith('$hello'):
                await message.channel.send('Hello World!')


If an event handler raises an exception, :func:`on_error` will be called
to handle it, which defaults to logging the traceback and ignoring the exception.

.. warning::

    All the events must be a |coroutine_link|_. If they aren't, then you might get unexpected
    errors. In order to turn a function into a coroutine they must be ``async def``
    functions.

App Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. function:: on_raw_app_command_permissions_update(payload)

    Called when application command permissions are updated.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0

    :param payload: The raw event payload data.
    :type payload: :class:`RawAppCommandPermissionsUpdateEvent`

.. function:: on_app_command_completion(interaction, command)

    Called when a :class:`app_commands.Command` or :class:`app_commands.ContextMenu` has
    successfully completed without error.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0

    :param interaction: The interaction of the command.
    :type interaction: :class:`Interaction`
    :param command: The command that completed successfully
    :type command: Union[:class:`app_commands.Command`, :class:`app_commands.ContextMenu`]

AutoMod
~~~~~~~~

.. function:: on_automod_rule_create(rule)

    Called when a :class:`AutoModRule` is created.
    You must have :attr:`~Permissions.manage_guild` to receive this.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.auto_moderation_configuration` to be enabled.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0

    :param rule: The rule that was created.
    :type rule: :class:`AutoModRule`

.. function:: on_automod_rule_update(rule)

    Called when a :class:`AutoModRule` is updated.
    You must have :attr:`~Permissions.manage_guild` to receive this.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0

    :param rule: The rule that was updated.
    :type rule: :class:`AutoModRule`

.. function:: on_automod_rule_delete(rule)

    Called when a :class:`AutoModRule` is deleted.
    You must have :attr:`~Permissions.manage_guild` to receive this.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.auto_moderation_configuration` to be enabled.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0

    :param rule: The rule that was deleted.
    :type rule: :class:`AutoModRule`

.. function:: on_automod_action(execution)

    Called when a :class:`AutoModAction` is created/performed.
    You must have :attr:`~Permissions.manage_guild` to receive this.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.auto_moderation_execution` to be enabled.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0

    :param execution: The rule execution that was performed.
    :type execution: :class:`AutoModAction`

Channels
~~~~~~~~~

.. function:: on_guild_channel_delete(channel)
              on_guild_channel_create(channel)

    Called whenever a guild channel is deleted or created.

    Note that you can get the guild from :attr:`~abc.GuildChannel.guild`.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.guilds` to be enabled.

    :param channel: The guild channel that got created or deleted.
    :type channel: :class:`abc.GuildChannel`

.. function:: on_guild_channel_update(before, after)

    Called whenever a guild channel is updated. e.g. changed name, topic, permissions.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.guilds` to be enabled.

    :param before: The updated guild channel's old info.
    :type before: :class:`abc.GuildChannel`
    :param after: The updated guild channel's new info.
    :type after: :class:`abc.GuildChannel`

.. function:: on_guild_channel_pins_update(channel, last_pin)

    Called whenever a message is pinned or unpinned from a guild channel.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.guilds` to be enabled.

    :param channel: The guild channel that had its pins updated.
    :type channel: Union[:class:`abc.GuildChannel`, :class:`Thread`]
    :param last_pin: The latest message that was pinned as an aware datetime in UTC. Could be ``None``.
    :type last_pin: Optional[:class:`datetime.datetime`]

.. function:: on_private_channel_update(before, after)

    Called whenever a private group DM is updated. e.g. changed name or topic.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.messages` to be enabled.

    :param before: The updated group channel's old info.
    :type before: :class:`GroupChannel`
    :param after: The updated group channel's new info.
    :type after: :class:`GroupChannel`

.. function:: on_private_channel_pins_update(channel, last_pin)

    Called whenever a message is pinned or unpinned from a private channel.

    :param channel: The private channel that had its pins updated.
    :type channel: :class:`abc.PrivateChannel`
    :param last_pin: The latest message that was pinned as an aware datetime in UTC. Could be ``None``.
    :type last_pin: Optional[:class:`datetime.datetime`]

.. function:: on_typing(channel, user, when)

    Called when someone begins typing a message.

    The ``channel`` parameter can be a :class:`abc.Messageable` instance.
    Which could either be :class:`TextChannel`, :class:`GroupChannel`, or
    :class:`DMChannel`.

    If the ``channel`` is a :class:`TextChannel` then the ``user`` parameter
    is a :class:`Member`, otherwise it is a :class:`User`.

    If the channel or user could not be found in the internal cache this event
    will not be called, you may use :func:`on_raw_typing` instead.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.typing` to be enabled.

    :param channel: The location where the typing originated from.
    :type channel: :class:`abc.Messageable`
    :param user: The user that started typing.
    :type user: Union[:class:`User`, :class:`Member`]
    :param when: When the typing started as an aware datetime in UTC.
    :type when: :class:`datetime.datetime`

.. function:: on_raw_typing(payload)

    Called when someone begins typing a message. Unlike :func:`on_typing` this
    is called regardless of the channel and user being in the internal cache.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.typing` to be enabled.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0

    :param payload: The raw event payload data.
    :type payload: :class:`RawTypingEvent`

Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. function:: on_connect()

    Called when the client has successfully connected to Discord. This is not
    the same as the client being fully prepared, see :func:`on_ready` for that.

    The warnings on :func:`on_ready` also apply.

.. function:: on_disconnect()

    Called when the client has disconnected from Discord, or a connection attempt to Discord has failed.
    This could happen either through the internet being disconnected, explicit calls to close,
    or Discord terminating the connection one way or the other.

    This function can be called many times without a corresponding :func:`on_connect` call.

.. function:: on_shard_connect(shard_id)

    Similar to :func:`on_connect` except used by :class:`AutoShardedClient`
    to denote when a particular shard ID has connected to Discord.

    .. versionadded:: 1.4

    :param shard_id: The shard ID that has connected.
    :type shard_id: :class:`int`


.. function:: on_shard_disconnect(shard_id)

    Similar to :func:`on_disconnect` except used by :class:`AutoShardedClient`
    to denote when a particular shard ID has disconnected from Discord.

    .. versionadded:: 1.4

    :param shard_id: The shard ID that has disconnected.
    :type shard_id: :class:`int`

Debug
~~~~~~

.. function:: on_error(event, *args, **kwargs)

    Usually when an event raises an uncaught exception, a traceback is
    logged to stderr and the exception is ignored. If you want to
    change this behaviour and handle the exception for whatever reason
    yourself, this event can be overridden. Which, when done, will
    suppress the default action of printing the traceback.

    The information of the exception raised and the exception itself can
    be retrieved with a standard call to :func:`sys.exc_info`.

    .. note::

        ``on_error`` will only be dispatched to :meth:`Client.event`.

        It will not be received by :meth:`Client.wait_for`, or, if used,
        :ref:`ext_commands_api_bot` listeners such as
        :meth:`~ext.commands.Bot.listen` or :meth:`~ext.commands.Cog.listener`.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.0

        The traceback is now logged rather than printed.

    :param event: The name of the event that raised the exception.
    :type event: :class:`str`

    :param args: The positional arguments for the event that raised the
        exception.
    :param kwargs: The keyword arguments for the event that raised the
        exception.

.. function:: on_socket_event_type(event_type)

    Called whenever a websocket event is received from the WebSocket.

    This is mainly useful for logging how many events you are receiving
    from the Discord gateway.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0

    :param event_type: The event type from Discord that is received, e.g. ``'READY'``.
    :type event_type: :class:`str`

.. function:: on_socket_raw_receive(msg)

    Called whenever a message is completely received from the WebSocket, before
    it's processed and parsed. This event is always dispatched when a
    complete message is received and the passed data is not parsed in any way.

    This is only really useful for grabbing the WebSocket stream and
    debugging purposes.

    This requires setting the ``enable_debug_events`` setting in the :class:`Client`.

    .. note::

        This is only for the messages received from the client
        WebSocket. The voice WebSocket will not trigger this event.

    :param msg: The message passed in from the WebSocket library.
    :type msg: :class:`str`

.. function:: on_socket_raw_send(payload)

    Called whenever a send operation is done on the WebSocket before the
    message is sent. The passed parameter is the message that is being
    sent to the WebSocket.

    This is only really useful for grabbing the WebSocket stream and
    debugging purposes.

    This requires setting the ``enable_debug_events`` setting in the :class:`Client`.

    .. note::

        This is only for the messages sent from the client
        WebSocket. The voice WebSocket will not trigger this event.

    :param payload: The message that is about to be passed on to the
                    WebSocket library. It can be :class:`bytes` to denote a binary
                    message or :class:`str` to denote a regular text message.
    :type payload: Union[:class:`bytes`, :class:`str`]


Entitlements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. function:: on_entitlement_create(entitlement)

    Called when a user subscribes to a SKU.

    .. versionadded:: 2.4

    :param entitlement: The entitlement that was created.
    :type entitlement: :class:`Entitlement`

.. function:: on_entitlement_update(entitlement)

    Called when a user updates their subscription to a SKU. This is usually called when
    the user renews or cancels their subscription.

    .. versionadded:: 2.4

    :param entitlement: The entitlement that was updated.
    :type entitlement: :class:`Entitlement`

.. function:: on_entitlement_delete(entitlement)

    Called when a users subscription to a SKU is cancelled. This is typically only called when:

    - Discord issues a refund for the subscription.
    - Discord removes an entitlement from a user.

    .. warning::

        This event won't be called if the user cancels their subscription manually, instead
        :func:`on_entitlement_update` will be called with :attr:`Entitlement.ends_at` set to the end of the
        current billing period.

    .. versionadded:: 2.4

    :param entitlement: The entitlement that was deleted.
    :type entitlement: :class:`Entitlement`


Gateway
~~~~~~~~

.. function:: on_ready()

    Called when the client is done preparing the data received from Discord. Usually after login is successful
    and the :attr:`Client.guilds` and co. are filled up.

    .. warning::

        This function is not guaranteed to be the first event called.
        Likewise, this function is **not** guaranteed to only be called
        once. This library implements reconnection logic and thus will
        end up calling this event whenever a RESUME request fails.

.. function:: on_resumed()

    Called when the client has resumed a session.

.. function:: on_shard_ready(shard_id)

    Similar to :func:`on_ready` except used by :class:`AutoShardedClient`
    to denote when a particular shard ID has become ready.

    :param shard_id: The shard ID that is ready.
    :type shard_id: :class:`int`


.. function:: on_shard_resumed(shard_id)

    Similar to :func:`on_resumed` except used by :class:`AutoShardedClient`
    to denote when a particular shard ID has resumed a session.

    .. versionadded:: 1.4

    :param shard_id: The shard ID that has resumed.
    :type shard_id: :class:`int`

Guilds
~~~~~~~

.. function:: on_guild_available(guild)
              on_guild_unavailable(guild)

    Called when a guild becomes available or unavailable. The guild must have
    existed in the :attr:`Client.guilds` cache.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.guilds` to be enabled.

    :param guild: The :class:`Guild` that has changed availability.

.. function:: on_guild_join(guild)

    Called when a :class:`Guild` is either created by the :class:`Client` or when the
    :class:`Client` joins a guild.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.guilds` to be enabled.

    :param guild: The guild that was joined.
    :type guild: :class:`Guild`

.. function:: on_guild_remove(guild)

    Called when a :class:`Guild` is removed from the :class:`Client`.

    This happens through, but not limited to, these circumstances:

    - The client got banned.
    - The client got kicked.
    - The client left the guild.
    - The client or the guild owner deleted the guild.

    In order for this event to be invoked then the :class:`Client` must have
    been part of the guild to begin with. (i.e. it is part of :attr:`Client.guilds`)

    This requires :attr:`Intents.guilds` to be enabled.

    :param guild: The guild that got removed.
    :type guild: :class:`Guild`

.. function:: on_guild_update(before, after)

    Called when a :class:`Guild` updates, for example:

    - Changed name
    - Changed AFK channel
    - Changed AFK timeout
    - etc

    This requires :attr:`Intents.guilds` to be enabled.

    :param before: The guild prior to being updated.
    :type before: :class:`Guild`
    :param after: The guild after being updated.
    :type after: :class:`Guild`

.. function:: on_guild_emojis_update(guild, before, after)

    Called when a :class:`Guild` adds or removes :class:`Emoji`.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.emojis_and_stickers` to be enabled.

    :param guild: The guild who got their emojis updated.
    :type guild: :class:`Guild`
    :param before: A list of emojis before the update.
    :type before: Sequence[:class:`Emoji`]
    :param after: A list of emojis after the update.
    :type after: Sequence[:class:`Emoji`]

.. function:: on_guild_stickers_update(guild, before, after)

    Called when a :class:`Guild` updates its stickers.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.emojis_and_stickers` to be enabled.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0

    :param guild: The guild who got their stickers updated.
    :type guild: :class:`Guild`
    :param before: A list of stickers before the update.
    :type before: Sequence[:class:`GuildSticker`]
    :param after: A list of stickers after the update.
    :type after: Sequence[:class:`GuildSticker`]

.. function:: on_audit_log_entry_create(entry)

    Called when a :class:`Guild` gets a new audit log entry.
    You must have :attr:`~Permissions.view_audit_log` to receive this.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.moderation` to be enabled.

    .. versionadded:: 2.2

    .. warning::

        Audit log entries received through the gateway are subject to data retrieval
        from cache rather than REST. This means that some data might not be present
        when you expect it to be. For example, the :attr:`AuditLogEntry.target`
        attribute will usually be a :class:`discord.Object` and the
        :attr:`AuditLogEntry.user` attribute will depend on user and member cache.

        To get the user ID of entry, :attr:`AuditLogEntry.user_id` can be used instead.

    :param entry: The audit log entry that was created.
    :type entry: :class:`AuditLogEntry`

.. function:: on_invite_create(invite)

    Called when an :class:`Invite` is created.
    You must have :attr:`~Permissions.manage_channels` to receive this.

    .. versionadded:: 1.3

    .. note::

        There is a rare possibility that the :attr:`Invite.guild` and :attr:`Invite.channel`
        attributes will be of :class:`Object` rather than the respective models.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.invites` to be enabled.

    :param invite: The invite that was created.
    :type invite: :class:`Invite`

.. function:: on_invite_delete(invite)

    Called when an :class:`Invite` is deleted.
    You must have :attr:`~Permissions.manage_channels` to receive this.

    .. versionadded:: 1.3

    .. note::

        There is a rare possibility that the :attr:`Invite.guild` and :attr:`Invite.channel`
        attributes will be of :class:`Object` rather than the respective models.

        Outside of those two attributes, the only other attribute guaranteed to be
        filled by the Discord gateway for this event is :attr:`Invite.code`.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.invites` to be enabled.

    :param invite: The invite that was deleted.
    :type invite: :class:`Invite`


Integrations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    :type channel: :class:`abc.GuildChannel`

.. function:: on_raw_integration_delete(payload)

    Called when an integration is deleted.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.integrations` to be enabled.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0

    :param payload: The raw event payload data.
    :type payload: :class:`RawIntegrationDeleteEvent`

Interactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. function:: on_interaction(interaction)

    Called when an interaction happened.

    This currently happens due to slash command invocations or components being used.

    .. warning::

        This is a low level function that is not generally meant to be used.
        If you are working with components, consider using the callbacks associated
        with the :class:`~discord.ui.View` instead as it provides a nicer user experience.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0

    :type interaction: :class:`Interaction`

Members
~~~~~~~~

.. function:: on_member_join(member)

    This requires :attr:`Intents.members` to be enabled.

    :param member: The member who joined.
    :type member: :class:`Member`

.. function:: on_member_remove(member)

    Called when a :class:`Member` leaves a :class:`Guild`.

    If the guild or member could not be found in the internal cache this event
    will not be called, you may use :func:`on_raw_member_remove` instead.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.members` to be enabled.

    :param member: The member who left.
    :type member: :class:`Member`

.. function:: on_raw_member_remove(payload)

    Called when a :class:`Member` leaves a :class:`Guild`.

    Unlike :func:`on_member_remove`
    this is called regardless of the guild or member being in the internal cache.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.members` to be enabled.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0

    :param payload: The raw event payload data.
    :type payload: :class:`RawMemberRemoveEvent`

.. function:: on_member_update(before, after)

    Called when a :class:`Member` updates their profile.

    This is called when one or more of the following things change:

    - nickname
    - roles
    - pending
    - timeout
    - guild avatar
    - flags

    Due to a Discord limitation, this event is not dispatched when a member's timeout expires.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.members` to be enabled.

    :param before: The updated member's old info.
    :type before: :class:`Member`

    :param guild: The guild the user got banned from.
    :type guild: :class:`Guild`
    :param user: The user that got banned.
                 Can be either :class:`User` or :class:`Member` depending if
                 the user was in the guild or not at the time of removal.
    :type user: Union[:class:`User`, :class:`Member`]

.. function:: on_member_unban(guild, user)

    This requires :attr:`Intents.presences` and :attr:`Intents.members` to be enabled.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0

    :param before: The updated member's old info.
    :type before: :class:`Member`
    :param after: The updated member's updated info.
    :type after: :class:`Member`

Messages
~~~~~~~~~

.. function:: on_message(message)

    Called when a :class:`Message` is created and sent.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.messages` to be enabled.

    .. warning::

        Your bot's own messages and private messages are sent through this
        event. This can lead cases of 'recursion' depending on how your bot was
        programmed. If you want the bot to not reply to itself, consider
        checking the user IDs. Note that :class:`~ext.commands.Bot` does not
        have this problem.

    :param message: The current message.
    :type message: :class:`Message`

.. function:: on_message_edit(before, after)

    Called when a :class:`Message` receives an update event. If the message is not found
    in the internal message cache, then these events will not be called.
    Messages might not be in cache if the message is too old
    or the client is participating in high traffic guilds.

    If this occurs increase the :class:`max_messages <Client>` parameter
    or use the :func:`on_raw_message_edit` event instead.

    The following non-exhaustive cases trigger this event:

    - A message has been pinned or unpinned.
    - The message content has been changed.
    - The message has received an embed.

        - For performance reasons, the embed server does not do this in a "consistent" manner.

    - The message's embeds were suppressed or unsuppressed.
    - A call message has received an update to its participants or ending time.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.messages` to be enabled.

    :param before: The previous version of the message.
    :type before: :class:`Message`
    :param after: The current version of the message.
    :type after: :class:`Message`

.. function:: on_message_delete(message)

    Called when a message is deleted. If the message is not found in the
    internal message cache, then this event will not be called.
    Messages might not be in cache if the message is too old
    or the client is participating in high traffic guilds.

    If this occurs increase the :class:`max_messages <Client>` parameter
    or use the :func:`on_raw_message_delete` event instead.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.messages` to be enabled.

    :param message: The deleted message.
    :type message: :class:`Message`

.. function:: on_bulk_message_delete(messages)

    Called when messages are bulk deleted. If none of the messages deleted
    are found in the internal message cache, then this event will not be called.
    If individual messages were not found in the internal message cache,
    this event will still be called, but the messages not found will not be included in
    the messages list. Messages might not be in cache if the message is too old
    or the client is participating in high traffic guilds.

    If this occurs increase the :class:`max_messages <Client>` parameter
    or use the :func:`on_raw_bulk_message_delete` event instead.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.messages` to be enabled.

    :param messages: The messages that have been deleted.
    :type messages: List[:class:`Message`]

.. function:: on_raw_message_edit(payload)

    Called when a message is edited. Unlike :func:`on_message_edit`, this is called
    regardless of the state of the internal message cache.

    If the message is found in the message cache,
    it can be accessed via :attr:`RawMessageUpdateEvent.cached_message`. The cached message represents
    the message before it has been edited. For example, if the content of a message is modified and
    triggers the :func:`on_raw_message_edit` coroutine, the :attr:`RawMessageUpdateEvent.cached_message`
    will return a :class:`Message` object that represents the message before the content was modified.

    Due to the inherently raw nature of this event, the data parameter coincides with
    the raw data given by the :ddocs:`gateway <topics/gateway-events#message-update>`.

    Since the data payload can be partial, care must be taken when accessing stuff in the dictionary.
    One example of a common case of partial data is when the ``'content'`` key is inaccessible. This
    denotes an "embed" only edit, which is an edit in which only the embeds are updated by the Discord
    embed server.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.messages` to be enabled.

    :param payload: The raw event payload data.
    :type payload: :class:`RawMessageUpdateEvent`


.. function:: on_raw_message_delete(payload)

    Called when a message is deleted. Unlike :func:`on_message_delete`, this is
    called regardless of the message being in the internal message cache or not.

    If the message is found in the message cache,
    it can be accessed via :attr:`RawMessageDeleteEvent.cached_message`

    This requires :attr:`Intents.messages` to be enabled.

    :param payload: The raw event payload data.
    :type payload: :class:`RawMessageDeleteEvent`

.. function:: on_raw_bulk_message_delete(payload)

    Called when a bulk delete is triggered. Unlike :func:`on_bulk_message_delete`, this is
    called regardless of the messages being in the internal message cache or not.

    If the messages are found in the message cache,
    they can be accessed via :attr:`RawBulkMessageDeleteEvent.cached_messages`

    This requires :attr:`Intents.messages` to be enabled.

    :param payload: The raw event payload data.
    :type payload: :class:`RawBulkMessageDeleteEvent`

Polls
~~~~~~

.. function:: on_poll_vote_add(user, answer)
              on_poll_vote_remove(user, answer)

    Called when a :class:`Poll` gains or loses a vote. If the ``user`` or ``answer``'s poll
    parent message are not cached then this event will not be called.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.message_content` and :attr:`Intents.polls` to be enabled.

    .. note::

        If the poll allows multiple answers and the user removes or adds multiple votes, this
        event will be called as many times as votes that are added or removed.

    .. versionadded:: 2.4

    :param user: The user that performed the action.
    :type user: Union[:class:`User`, :class:`Member`]
    :param answer: The answer the user voted or removed their vote from.
    :type answer: :class:`PollAnswer`

.. function:: on_raw_poll_vote_add(payload)
              on_raw_poll_vote_remove(payload)

    Called when a :class:`Poll` gains or loses a vote. Unlike :func:`on_poll_vote_add` and :func:`on_poll_vote_remove`
    this is called regardless of the state of the internal user and message cache.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.message_content` and :attr:`Intents.polls` to be enabled.

    .. note::

        If the poll allows multiple answers and the user removes or adds multiple votes, this
        event will be called as many times as votes that are added or removed.

    .. versionadded:: 2.4

    :param payload: The raw event payload data.
    :type payload: :class:`RawPollVoteActionEvent`

Reactions
~~~~~~~~~~

.. function:: on_reaction_add(reaction, user)

    Called when a message has a reaction added to it. Similar to :func:`on_message_edit`,
    if the message is not found in the internal message cache, then this
    event will not be called. Consider using :func:`on_raw_reaction_add` instead.

    .. note::

        To get the :class:`Message` being reacted, access it via :attr:`Reaction.message`.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.reactions` to be enabled.

    .. note::

        This doesn't require :attr:`Intents.members` within a guild context,
        but due to Discord not providing updated user information in a direct message
        it's required for direct messages to receive this event.
        Consider using :func:`on_raw_reaction_add` if you need this and do not otherwise want
        to enable the members intent.

    .. warning::

        This event does not have a way of differentiating whether a reaction is a
        burst reaction (also known as "super reaction") or not. If you need this,
        consider using :func:`on_raw_reaction_add` instead.

    :param reaction: The current state of the reaction.
    :type reaction: :class:`Reaction`
    :param user: The user who added the reaction.
    :type user: Union[:class:`Member`, :class:`User`]

.. function:: on_reaction_remove(reaction, user)

    Called when a message has a reaction removed from it. Similar to on_message_edit,
    if the message is not found in the internal message cache, then this event
    will not be called.

    .. note::

        To get the message being reacted, access it via :attr:`Reaction.message`.

    This requires both :attr:`Intents.reactions` and :attr:`Intents.members` to be enabled.

    .. note::

        Consider using :func:`on_raw_reaction_remove` if you need this and do not want
        to enable the members intent.

    .. warning::

        This event does not have a way of differentiating whether a reaction is a
        burst reaction (also known as "super reaction") or not. If you need this,

    if the message is not found in the internal message cache, then this event
    will not be called. Consider using :func:`on_raw_reaction_clear` instead.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.reactions` to be enabled.

    :param message: The message that had its reactions cleared.
    :type message: :class:`Message`
    :param reactions: The reactions that were removed.
    :type reactions: List[:class:`Reaction`]

.. function:: on_reaction_clear_emoji(reaction)

    Called when a message has a specific reaction removed from it. Similar to :func:`on_message_edit`,
    if the message is not found in the internal message cache, then this event

Abstract Base Classes
-----------------------

An :term:`abstract base class` (also known as an ``abc``) is a class that models can inherit
to get their behaviour. **Abstract base classes should not be instantiated**.
They are mainly there for usage with :func:`isinstance` and :func:`issubclass`\.

This library has a module related to abstract base classes, in which all the ABCs are subclasses of
:class:`typing.Protocol`.

Discord Models
---------------

Models are classes that are received from Discord and are not meant to be created by
the user of the library.

.. danger::

    The classes listed below are **not intended to be created by users** and are also
    **read-only**.

    For example, this means that you should not make your own :class:`User` instances
    nor should you modify the :class:`User` instance yourself.

    If you want to get one of these model classes instances they'd have to be through
    the cache, and a common way of doing so is through the :func:`utils.find` function
    or attributes of model classes that you receive from the events specified in the
    :ref:`discord-api-events`.

.. note::

    Nearly all classes here have :ref:`py:slots` defined which means that it is
    impossible to have dynamic attributes to the data classes.

Data Classes
--------------

Some classes are just there to be data containers, this lists them.

Unlike :ref:`models <discord_api_models>` you are allowed to create
most of these yourself, even if they can also be used to hold attributes.

Nearly all classes here have :ref:`py:slots` defined which means that it is
impossible to have dynamic attributes to the data classes.

The only exception to this rule is :class:`Object`, which is made with
dynamic attributes in mind.
