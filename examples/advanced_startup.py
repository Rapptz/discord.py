    # see https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/logging.html and https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html

    # discord.utils.setup_logging(handler=handler, root=False)

    # One of the reasons to take over more of the process though
    # is to ensure use with other libraries or tools which also require their own cleanup.
