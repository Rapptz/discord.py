class ExponentialBackoff:
    """An implementation of the exponential backoff algorithm

    Provides a convenient interface to implement an exponential backoff
    for reconnecting or retrying transmissions in a distributed network.

    Once instantiated, the delay method will return the next interval to
    wait for when retrying a connection or transmission.  The maximum
    delay increases exponentially with each retry up to a maximum of
    2^10 * base, and is reset if no more attempts are needed in a period
    of 2^11 * base seconds.

    Parameters
    ----------
    base: :class:`int`
        The base delay in seconds. The first retry-delay will be up to
        this many seconds.
    integral: :class:`bool`
        Set to ``True`` if whole periods of base is desirable, otherwise any
        number in between may be returned.
