    Attributes
    -----------
    name: :class:`str`
        The thread name.
    guild: :class:`Guild`
        The guild the thread belongs to.
    id: :class:`int`
        The thread ID. This is the same as the thread starter message ID.
    parent_id: :class:`int`
        The parent :class:`TextChannel` or :class:`ForumChannel` ID this thread belongs to.
    owner_id: :class:`int`
        The user's ID that created this thread.
    last_message_id: Optional[:class:`int`]
        The last message ID of the message sent to this thread. It may
        *not* point to an existing or valid message.
    slowmode_delay: :class:`int`
        The number of seconds a member must wait between sending messages
        in this thread. A value of ``0`` denotes that it is disabled.
        Bots and users with :attr:`~Permissions.manage_channels` or
        :attr:`~Permissions.manage_messages` bypass slowmode.
    message_count: :class:`int`
        An approximate number of messages in this thread.
    member_count: :class:`int`
        An approximate number of members in this thread. This caps at 50.
    me: Optional[:class:`ThreadMember`]
        A thread member representing yourself, if you've joined the thread.
        This could not be available.
    archived: :class:`bool`
        Whether the thread is archived.
    locked: :class:`bool`
        Whether the thread is locked.
    invitable: :class:`bool`
        Whether non-moderators can add other non-moderators to this thread.
        This is always ``True`` for public threads.
    archiver_id: Optional[:class:`int`]
        The user's ID that archived this thread.

        .. note::
            Due to an API change, the ``archiver_id`` will always be ``None`` and can only be obtained via the audit log.

    auto_archive_duration: :class:`int`
        The duration in minutes until the thread is automatically hidden from the channel list.
        Usually a value of 60, 1440, 4320 and 10080.
    archive_timestamp: :class:`datetime.datetime`
        An aware timestamp of when the thread's archived status was last updated in UTC.

        Edits the thread.

        Editing the thread requires :attr:`.Permissions.manage_threads`. The thread
        creator can also edit ``name``, ``archived`` or ``auto_archive_duration``.
        Note that if the thread is locked then only those with :attr:`.Permissions.manage_threads`
        can unarchive a thread.

        The thread must be unarchived to be edited.

        Parameters
        ------------
        name: :class:`str`
            The new name of the thread.
        archived: :class:`bool`
            Whether to archive the thread or not.

            Whether to lock the thread or not.
        pinned: :class:`bool`
            Whether to pin the thread or not. This only works if the thread is part of a forum.

            Only available for private threads.
        auto_archive_duration: :class:`int`
            The new duration in minutes before a thread is automatically hidden from the channel list.
            Must be one of ``60``, ``1440``, ``4320``, or ``10080``.
        slowmode_delay: :class:`int`
            Specifies the slowmode rate limit for user in this thread, in seconds.
            A value of ``0`` disables slowmode. The maximum value possible is ``21600``.
        applied_tags: Sequence[:class:`ForumTag`]
            The new tags to apply to the thread. There can only be up to 5 tags applied to a thread.
