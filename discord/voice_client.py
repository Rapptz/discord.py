Some documentation to refer to:

- Our main web socket (mWS) sends opcode 4 with a guild ID and channel ID.
- The mWS receives VOICE_STATE_UPDATE and VOICE_SERVER_UPDATE.
- We pull the session_id from VOICE_STATE_UPDATE.
- We pull the token, endpoint and server_id from VOICE_SERVER_UPDATE.
- Then we initiate the voice web socket (vWS) pointing to the endpoint.
- We send opcode 0 with the user_id, server_id, session_id and token using the vWS.
- The vWS sends back opcode 2 with an ssrc, port, modes(array) and heartbeat_interval.
- We send a UDP discovery packet to endpoint:port and receive our IP and our port in LE.
- Then we send our IP and port via vWS with opcode 1.
- When that's all done, we receive opcode 4 from the vWS.
- Finally we can transmit data to endpoint:port.

        Within this method, to start the voice connection flow it is recommended to

        The finalizer, ``after`` is called after the source has been exhausted

        If an error happens while the audio player is running, the exception is
        caught and the audio player is then stopped.  If no after callback is
        passed, any caught exception will be logged using the library logger.

        .. versionchanged:: 2.0
            Instead of writing to ``sys.stderr``, the library's logger is used.

        Parameters
        -----------
        source: :class:`AudioSource`
            The audio source we're reading from.
        after: Callable[[Optional[:class:`Exception`]], Any]

        -------
        ClientException

            Source is not a :class:`AudioSource` or after is not a callable.
