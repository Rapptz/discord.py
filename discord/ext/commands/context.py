class Context(discord.abc.Messageable, Generic[BotT]):
    r"""Represents the context in which a command is being invoked under.

    This class contains a lot of meta data to help you understand more about
    the invocation context. This class is not created manually and is instead
    passed around to commands as the first parameter.

    This class implements the :class:`~discord.abc.Messageable` ABC.

    Attributes
    -----------
    message: :class:`.Message`
        The message that triggered the command being executed.

        .. note::

            In the case of an interaction based context, this message is "synthetic"
            and does not actually exist. Therefore, the ID on it is invalid similar
            to ephemeral messages.
    bot: :class:`.Bot`
        The bot that contains the command being executed.
    args: :class:`list`
        The list of transformed arguments that were passed into the command.
        If this is accessed during the :func:`.on_command_error` event
        then this list could be incomplete.
    kwargs: :class:`dict`
        A dictionary of transformed arguments that were passed into the command.
        Similar to :attr:`args`\, if this is accessed in the
        :func:`.on_command_error` event then this dict could be incomplete.
    current_parameter: Optional[:class:`Parameter`]
        The parameter that is currently being inspected and converted.
        This is only of use for within converters.

        .. versionadded:: 2.0
    current_argument: Optional[:class:`str`]
        The argument string of the :attr:`current_parameter` that is currently being converted.
        This is only of use for within converters.

        .. versionadded:: 2.0
    interaction: Optional[:class:`~discord.Interaction`]
        The interaction associated with this context.

        .. versionadded:: 2.0
    prefix: Optional[:class:`str`]
        The prefix that was used to invoke the command. For interaction based contexts,
        this is ``/`` for slash commands and ``\u200b`` for context menu commands.
    command: Optional[:class:`Command`]
        The command that is being invoked currently.
    invoked_with: Optional[:class:`str`]
        The command name that triggered this invocation. Useful for finding out
        which alias called the command.
    invoked_parents: List[:class:`str`]
        The command names of the parents that triggered this invocation. Useful for
        finding out which aliases called the command.

        For example in commands ``?a b c test``, the invoked parents are ``['a', 'b', 'c']``.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7

    invoked_subcommand: Optional[:class:`Command`]
        The subcommand that was invoked.
        If no valid subcommand was invoked then this is equal to ``None``.
    subcommand_passed: Optional[:class:`str`]
        The string that was attempted to call a subcommand. This does not have
        to point to a valid registered subcommand and could just point to a
        nonsense string. If nothing was passed to attempt a call to a
        subcommand then this is set to ``None``.
    command_failed: :class:`bool`
        A boolean that indicates if the command failed to be parsed, checked,
        or invoked.

        Creates a context from a :class:`discord.Interaction`. This only
        works on application command based interactions, such as slash commands
        or context menus.

        On slash command based interactions this creates a synthetic :class:`~discord.Message`
        that points to an ephemeral message that the command invoker has executed. This means
        that :attr:`Context.author` returns the member that invoked the command.

        In a message context menu based interaction, the :attr:`Context.message` attribute
        is the message that the command is being executed on. This means that :attr:`Context.author`
        returns the author of the message being targetted. To get the member that invoked
        the command then :attr:`discord.Interaction.user` should be used instead.

        Calls a command with the arguments given.

        This is useful if you want to just call the callback that a
        :class:`.Command` holds internally.

        .. note::

            This does not handle converters, checks, cooldowns, pre-invoke,
            or after-invoke hooks in any matter. It calls the internal callback
            directly as-if it was a regular function.

            using this function.

            The command that is going to be called.
        \*args

        Calls the command again.

        This is similar to :meth:`~.Context.invoke` except that it bypasses
        checks, cooldowns, and error handlers.

        .. note::

            If you want to bypass :exc:`.UserInputError` derived exceptions,
            it is recommended to use the regular :meth:`~.Context.invoke`
            as it will work more naturally. After all, this will end up
            using the old arguments the user has used and will thus just
            fail again.

        Parameters
        ------------
        call_hooks: :class:`bool`
            Whether to call the before and after invoke hooks.
        restart: :class:`bool`
            Whether to start the call chain from the very beginning

        Shows the help command for the specified entity if given.
        The entity can be a command or a cog.

        If no entity is given, then it'll show help for the
        entire bot.

            Indicates if the message should be sent using text-to-speech.
        embed: :class:`~discord.Embed`
            The rich embed for the content.
        file: :class:`~discord.File`
            The file to upload.
        files: List[:class:`~discord.File`]
            A list of files to upload. Must be a maximum of 10.
        nonce: :class:`int`
            The nonce to use for sending this message. If the message was successfully sent,
            then the message will have a nonce with this value.
        delete_after: :class:`float`
            If provided, the number of seconds to wait in the background
            before deleting the message we just sent. If the deletion fails,
            then it is silently ignored.
        allowed_mentions: :class:`~discord.AllowedMentions`
            Controls the mentions being processed in this message. If this is
            passed, then the object is merged with :attr:`~discord.Client.allowed_mentions`.
            The merging behaviour only overrides attributes that have been explicitly passed

        reference: Union[:class:`~discord.Message`, :class:`~discord.MessageReference`, :class:`~discord.PartialMessage`]
            A reference to the :class:`~discord.Message` to which you are replying, this can be created using
            :meth:`~discord.Message.to_reference` or passed directly as a :class:`~discord.Message`. You can control
            whether this mentions the author of the referenced message using the :attr:`~discord.AllowedMentions.replied_user`
            attribute of ``allowed_mentions`` or by setting ``mention_author``.

            This is ignored for interaction based contexts.

        mention_author: Optional[:class:`bool`]

        embeds: List[:class:`~discord.Embed`]

        stickers: Sequence[Union[:class:`~discord.GuildSticker`, :class:`~discord.StickerItem`]]
            A list of stickers to upload. Must be a maximum of 3. This is ignored for interaction based contexts.

            .. versionadded:: 2.0
        suppress_embeds: :class:`bool`
            Whether to suppress embeds for the message. This sends the message without any embeds if set to ``True``.

            .. versionadded:: 2.0
        ephemeral: :class:`bool`
            Indicates if the message should only be visible to the user who started the interaction.
            If a view is sent with an ephemeral message and it has no timeout set then the timeout
            is set to 15 minutes. **This is only applicable in contexts with an interaction**.

            .. versionadded:: 2.0
        silent: :class:`bool`
            Whether to suppress push and desktop notifications for the message. This will increment the mention counter
            in the UI, but will not actually send a notification.

            .. versionadded:: 2.2

        poll: :class:`~discord.Poll`
            The poll to send with this message.
